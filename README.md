 # Pneumonia-detection-Project-using-NVIDIA-Jetson-Nano-2GB-Developer-kit
This project detects Pneumonia of patient with the help of X-ray images. We used Deep learning concept in detection of pneumonia
## Description

  
### This project uses Deep learning concept in detection of Various Deadly diseases.

### It can  detect Pneumonia.

### It uses CT-Scan and X-ray Images of chest/lung in detecting the disease.

### It has a Accuracy between 50%-80%.

### This project uses Deep learning concept in detection of Various Deadly diseases.

### It can take input in any Image format or through Live videos and provide accurate output results.
